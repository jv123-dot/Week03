
Bootstrap Accessibility: Bootstrap's components are designed to be generic so that they
work with touch or mouse/keyboard. If you assign the components with the right
"WAI" and "aria" traits you can make it accessibly for screen readers as well. 
Bootstrap's default color settings do NOT ensure proper color contrasting. Changes will
have to be made in this area to make it more legible

Bootstrap grid: Bootstrap's grid is a responsive system built upon Flexbox. Due to it
being mobile-first it automatically re-arranges to screensizes. There's an easily adjustable 
12 column per row system that you utilize to organize the content to the specifications 
that you want.
